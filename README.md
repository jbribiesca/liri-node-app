# liri-node-app
LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a _Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

# The Problem And The SOLUTION
Have you ever wanted to search for a song, movie, or concert but have to go to all sorts of different apps to do it?
Welcome the LIRI app, it will let you use predefined search terms to find exactly what you are looking for in an all in one solution.

# How to begin
All you have to do is call:
node liri.js

The application will give you instructions on how we should format the search results to find what you are looking for!

For example:

Concerts:
node liri.js concert-this garth brooks

Movies:
node liri.js movie-this scarface

Songs:
node liri.js spotify-this-song santeria

^ Replace the band, song, or movie name with the stuff of your choice (if we can't find what youre looking for we will suggest something for you!)

Feeling Lucky:
node liri.js do-what-it-says
